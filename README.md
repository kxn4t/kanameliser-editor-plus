### Missing BlendShape Inserter

A tool that standardizes BlendShape targets across multiple AnimationClips. It's primarily used when:

- You've modified your avatar's facial BlendShapes but kept the original animations
- Your facial expressions break or glitch when switching between animations
- You need to ensure consistent BlendShape manipulation across all animation files

The tool works by updating Animation files to operate on the same BlendShapes across all animations, preventing facial distortions and ensuring smooth transitions between different expression states.

## 📋 Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.22f1 or higher
- Optional: NDMF (Non-Destructive Modular Framework) for enhanced build preview support
- Optional: Modular Avatar 1.13.0 or higher for Material Swap Helper feature
