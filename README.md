- Two creation modes: unified and per-object Material Swap components

#### Material Setter
- Automatically create color change menus using Modular Avatar's Material Setter components

**Common Specifications:**
- Requires [Modular Avatar](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/) 1.13.0 or higher to be installed

### 😀 Missing BlendShape Inserter

- Automatically detects and fixes missing BlendShape keys across animation files
- Prevents facial expression glitches and broken animations
- Supports batch processing of multiple animation files
- Access via `Tools > Kanameliser Editor Plus > Missing BlendShape Inserter`
- This functionality is also integrated with [Zatools](https://zatools.kb10uy.dev/) for expanded workflow options
- For more detailed information, please refer to [Zatools/missing-blendshape-inserter](https://zatools.kb10uy.dev/editor-extension/missing-blendshape-inserter/)

## 🔧 Usage Tips

### Material Copier

Perfect for managing materials across multiple similar objects:

1. **Copy**: Select source GameObjects (e.g., Avatar_A, Avatar_B) → Right-click → `Copy Materials`
2. **Paste**: Select target GameObjects (e.g., Avatar_C, Avatar_D) → Right-click → `Paste Materials`
3. **Matching**: Materials are applied to objects with matching names (e.g., "Head" → "Head", "Body" → "body")

Common use cases:
- Copying outfit materials between different avatar variants

### MA Material Helper

Perfect for creating avatar color change menus from existing color variations:

1. **Copy**: Select color variation prefabs → Right-click → `Copy Material Setup`
   Tips: Works with multiple color variation prefabs selected simultaneously
2. **Create**: Select target outfit → Right-click → Choose one of the following:
   - `Create Material Swap` - Standard Material Swap mode
   - `Create Material Swap (Per Object)` - Per-object Material Swap mode
   - `Create Material Setter` - Material Setter mode
3. **Menu Generation**: Automatically creates "Color Menu" with numbered color variations (Color1, Color2, etc.)

**Material Swap Modes:**
- **Standard Mode**: Creates unified Material Swap components for better performance
- **Per-Object Mode**: Creates individual Material Swap components for each object (useful for complex setups)

**Material Setter Mode:**
- Directly replaces materials by creating Material Setter components for each object
- Uses a different parameter (`KEP_MaterialSetter`) from Material Swap

**Matching Specifications:**

The matching between source and target objects follows this priority order:

1. **Priority 1**: Exact relative path match (without root name) + Renderer present
   - Example: Source `Outfit/Jacket` → Target `Outfit/Jacket`
   - Example: Source `Accessories/Earing/Left` → Target `Accessories/Earing/Left`

2. **Priority 2**: Same hierarchy depth + exact name match + Renderer present
   - Example: Source `Outfit_A/Outer/Accessories/Earing` (depth=3) → Target `Outfit_B/Inner/Accessories/Earing` (depth=3)
   - Both objects are named `Earing` and at the same depth, even though parent names differ
   - Applies hierarchy filtering if multiple candidates exist at the same depth

3. **Priority 3**: Exact name match + Renderer present
   - Example: Source `Outfit/Outer/Jacket` (depth=3) → Target `Jacket` (depth=1)
   - Selects by closest depth if multiple `Jacket` objects exist
   - If source is depth 3 and targets are depth 1, 2, 4: prefers depth 2 or 4 (difference=1)
   - Applies hierarchy filtering if multiple candidates exist

4. **Priority 4**: Case-insensitive name match + Renderer present
   - Example: Source `earing` → Target `Earing`
   - Example: Source `JACKET` → Target `Jacket`
   - Selects by closest depth and applies hierarchy filtering

**Advanced Matching:**

When multiple candidates remain after priority matching:
- **Parent hierarchy filtering**: Matches parent names from bottom to top
  - Example: Looking for `Outfit/Outer/Jacket`
    - Candidates: `Outfit/Outer/Jacket`, `Costume/Outer/Jacket`, `Outfit/Inner/Jacket`
    - Filters by immediate parent: prefers candidates under `Outer` → 2 candidates remain
    - Filters by grandparent: prefers candidates under `Outfit` → `Outfit/Outer/Jacket` selected
- **Similarity scoring**: Uses Levenshtein distance for final selection
  - Example: Pasting to `Outfit_C` with candidates from `Outfit_A` and `Outfit_C`
    - Compares root names: `Outfit_C` vs `Outfit_A` and `Outfit_C` vs `Outfit_C`
    - Prefers `Outfit_C` source (distance=0) over `Outfit_A` source (distance=2)

Common use cases:
- Creating color change menus for avatar outfits
- Batch creation of color change menus from existing color variation prefabs

### Missing BlendShape Inserter

A tool that standardizes BlendShape targets across multiple AnimationClips. It's primarily used when:

- You've modified your avatar's facial BlendShapes but kept the original animations
- Your facial expressions break or glitch when switching between animations
- You need to ensure consistent BlendShape manipulation across all animation files

The tool works by updating Animation files to operate on the same BlendShapes across all animations, preventing facial distortions and ensuring smooth transitions between different expression states.

## 📋 Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.22f1 or higher
- Optional: NDMF (Non-Destructive Modular Framework) for enhanced build preview support
- Optional: Modular Avatar 1.13.0 or higher for Material Swap Helper feature
